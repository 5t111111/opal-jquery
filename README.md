RQuery
======

RQuery is the default DOM library for opal which provides the DOM
manupulation features found in jQuery or zepto. RQuery does not bundle
either of these libraries, and they must be present in the page before
rquery loads. RQuery is limited to the featyres offered by zepto as it
will work with either jquery or zepto. rquery-extras adds in the
additional features from jquery.
